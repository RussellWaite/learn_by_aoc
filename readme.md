# Learn by AoC (Advent of Code)

This is my attempt to clean up my various experiments with Advent of Code whilst learning new languages. So far I've used Advent of Code for Rust, Python and Go. Rather than have multiple repos for each languages and each year, I decided to group them all together under one.

As I am using the challenges as a fun means of learning the languages, they might not be the best example of idiomatic usage of a language and the quality will probably (hopefully) vary as I get more familiar with the language. I'm not going through the challenges in order though, and don't I plan on fully completing each year.
